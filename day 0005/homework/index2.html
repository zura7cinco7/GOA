<h2>about book</h2>
<p>In the book that People magazine proclaimed “beguiling” and “fascinating,” Robert Greene and Joost Elffers have distilled three thousand years of the history of power into 48 essential laws by drawing from the philosophies of Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, and Carl Von Clausewitz and also from the lives of figures ranging from Henry Kissinger to P.T. Barnum.Some laws teach the need for prudence (“Law 1: Never Outshine the Master”), others teach the value of confidence (“Law 28: Enter Action with Boldness”), and many recommend absolute self-preservation (“Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally”). Every law, though, has one thing in common: an interest in total domination. In a bold and arresting two-color package, The 48 Laws of Power is ideal whether your aim is conquest, self-defense, or simply to understand the rules of the game.</p>

<h2>there are some imortant laws</h2>
<h3>Law 1: Never Outshine the Master Make those above you feel superior, even if you surpass them. In doing so, you'll gain favor and avoid resentment.</h3>
<h3>Law 3: Conceal Your Intentions Dont reveal everything about yourself or your plans. If people dont know what you're up to, they're less likely to interfere</h3>
<h3>Law 6: Court Attention at All Costs Visibility is key. Even if its through controversy, make sure people notice you<h3>
