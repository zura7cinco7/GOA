            <p>Sinister is a 2012 supernatural horror film directed by Scott Derrickson, and written by C. Robert Cargill and Derrickson. It stars Ethan Hawke as a struggling true-crime writer whose discovery of snuff films depicting gruesome murders and strange supernatural elements in his new house puts his family in danger. Juliet Rylance, Fred Thompson, James Ransone, Clare Foley, Michael Hall D'Addario, and Vincent D'Onofrio appear in supporting roles.

                Sinister was inspired by a nightmare Cargill had after watching the 2002 film The Ring.[6] Principal photography on Sinister began in Autumn of 2011 on Long Island, New York with a production budget of $3 million.[4] To add to the authenticity of old home movies and snuff films, the Super 8 segments were shot on actual Super 8 cameras and film stock.[7] The film was a co-production between the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.
                
                It premiered at the SXSW festival on March 10, 2012.[8] It was released in the United Kingdom on October 5, 2012, and in the United States on October 12. Critics praised its acting, direction, cinematography and atmosphere, but criticised its use of jump scares and other horror clichés. It was a box office success, grossing $87.7 million against its budget of $3 million.[5] The resulting financial success led to a sequel, released in 2015.
                
                It has since developed a reputation for scariness and is considered a cult classic. A 2020 study by Broadband Choices named Sinister the scariest film ever made, based on an analysis of viewer heart rates.[9]</p>

            <p>The Conjuring is a 2013 American supernatural horror film directed by James Wan and written by Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes. It is the inaugural film in The Conjuring Universe franchise.[4] Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga star as Ed and Lorraine Warren, paranormal investigators and authors associated with prominent cases of haunting. Their purportedly real-life reports inspired The Amityville Horror story and the associated film franchise.[5] The Warrens come to the assistance of the Perron family, who experienced increasingly disturbing events in their newly occupied farmhouse in Rhode Island in 1971.

                Development of the film began in January 2012 and reports confirmed Wan as the director of a film entitled The Warren Files, later retitled The Conjuring. Production began in Wilmington, North Carolina, in February 2012 and scenes were shot in chronological order. The Conjuring was released in the United States and Canada on July 19, 2013, by Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema. It received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $319 million worldwide against its $20 million budget. A sequel, The Conjuring 2, was released in 2016.</p>

            <p>Rings[a] is a 2017 American supernatural horror film directed by F. Javier Gutiérrez and written by David Loucka, Jacob Aaron Estes and Akiva Goldsman.

Alex Roe, Johnny Galecki, Aimee Teegarden, Bonnie Morgan and Vincent D'Onofrio also star in supporting roles.

                Paramount Pictures had initially planned a third film, originally titled The Ring 3D, in early 2014, directed by Gutiérrez and written by Loucka and Estes. Later, Goldsman had been hired to co-write the script, while the film had been retitled to Rings. Principal photography began in March 2015, in Atlanta, and wrapped on May that same year. Reshoots took place in July 2016.
                
                Rings was released in the United States on February 3, 2017, by Paramount Pictures, and was a commercial success, grossing $83.1 million worldwide against its $25 million budget, but received largely negative reviews from critics, with criticism aimed at its mythology, similarities to previous films, reliance on jump scares, and special effects.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2NKzO-fxwQ">grudge trailer</a></h3>
            <p>The Grudge is a curse, born when someone dies in extreme rage or sorrow, and lingers where the person dies. Those who encounter it will die, and the curse is reborn repeatedly, passing from victim to victim in an endless growing chain of horror.

                In 2001, Kayako Saeki, a housewife in Tokyo, is in love with her college professor, Peter Kirk, obsessively writing about him in a diary. Her jealous husband Takeo discovers the diary, and believes Kayako is having an affair. In a fit of rage, he brutally murders her, their young son Toshio, and their pet cat Mar. After Takeo hides the bodies in the house, Kayako's ghost hangs him with her hair. After receiving a letter from Kayako, Peter visits the Saeki house only to find her and Takeo's corpses and Toshio's ghost. Shocked and horrified, he flees the scene and commits suicide the next day. The remainder of the Saeki family rises again as restless ghosts due to the curse, notably Kayako, who appears as an onryō.
                
                In 2004, the Williams family from America moved into the Saeki house for Matt's job. While Matt is thrilled with the house, his wife Jennifer and dementia-ridden mother Emma feel uncomfortable, the former experiencing culture shock and feeling lost as she can't speak Japanese, and the latter sensing that something is wrong with the house. The curse quickly consumes Matt and Jennifer. Matt's sister Susan is also haunted, as the curse follows her back into her apartment. Yoko, a care worker, arrives at the house to find Emma alone before she encounters Kayako, who drags her up into the attic. Concerned about Yoko's disappearance, her employer Alex sends another care worker, Karen Davis, to take over the care of Emma. Karen discovers Toshio sealed up in a wardrobe at the house and later witnesses Kayako's spirit descending from the ceilings to claim Emma.</p>
