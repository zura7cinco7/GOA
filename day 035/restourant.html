            In a large bowl, mix the onions, tomatoes, garlic and basil, taking care not to mash or break up the tomatoes too much. Add the balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. Add salt and pepper to taste. Mix again. Cover and chill for at least an hour. This will allow the flavours to soak and blend together.

            Slice the baguette loaf diagonally into 12 thick slices and lightly toast them until they are light brown on both sides. Serve the mixture on the warm slices of bread. If you prefer the mixture at room temperature, remove from the fridge half an hour before serving.

            <p>Creamy mushroom soup(120*)</p>

            <p>
                Mushrooms: Fresh brown or cremini mushrooms are perfect for this recipe. You could also use mini portobello mushrooms, or a combination of your favourite mushroom varieties.
                Herbs: The herbs that best compliment those incredible flavours are a combination of thyme and parsley. Of course, if you dont like those, you can also use rosemary, oregano, tarragon, chives or cilantro. Use what you love!
                Cream: Half and half, heavy cream, light cream or thickened cream all yield similar results, however heavy cream adds richness.
                Flour: We need flour to create that delicious, creamy texture mushroom soup is best known for. You can leave it out and use cornstarch if you wish. I recommend 2-3 tablespoons of cornstarch mixed with a ¼ cup of water (slurry). If unsure about what quantity will be best to your liking, add the cornstarch slurry in tablespoon increments, stirring in between, until youve achieved your ideal texture.

        <p>Easy Roasted Beef Tenderloin(210*)</p>
        <img src="https://www.recipetineats.com/tachyon/2023/12/Beef-tenderloin-with-mushroom-sauce_3.jpg?resize=900%2C1125&zoom=0.86" alt="Easy Roasted Beef Tenderloin" width="300" height="200">
        <p>
            Beef tenderloin, or "eye fillet," as it's known in other parts of the world, is cut from the middle of a cow. The tenderloin comes from the spine area, and hangs between the shoulder blade and hip socket. This muscle tissue doesn't do too much, so it's the most tender part of the cow. This Christmas roast is absolutely, positively, the softest, most buttery-textured meat on earth. And it's why I'm no longer a vegetarian.

Beef tenderloin is my go-to special occasion dish! It's wonderful for Christmas dinner or a New Year's Eve feast with duchess potatoes and some sort of vegetable side dish. Go find your meat thermometer now!

What cooking method is best for beef tenderloin?

Ladd usually prefers grilled tenderloin, but when it's cold outside, this oven-roasted method is the way to go. It's a little more hands-off than a grilled tenderloin which means, if you're making it for the holidays, you'll have free hands to make all the Christmas side dishes! Just keep a careful eye on it so that it doesn't overcook. This is very important. Rare is what you're going for!

        <p>Turkish Pasta(110*)</p>

            Ground beef pasta is nothing new, but this recipe takes it to the next level. Jamaican curry powder, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder create a unique mix. This combination adds a warm, aromatic flavor to the meat that is truly addictive.

Cooking the beef in a large skillet with diced onions and fresh garlic makes it flavorful, juicy, and nicely caramelized. The key is to mince the beef with a spatula as it cooks—you dont want large chunks here. The smaller crumbles absorb all those amazing spices, making each bite burst with flavor.

        <p>
            step 1
Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Butter 6 dariole moulds or basins well and place on a baking tray.

step 2
Put 100g butter and 100g chopped dark chocolate in a heatproof bowl and set over a pan of hot water (or alternatively put in the microwave and melt in 30 second bursts on a low setting) and stir until smooth. Set aside to cool slightly for 15 mins.

step 3
Using an electric hand whisk, mix in 150g light brown soft sugar, then 3 large eggs, one at a time, followed by ½ tsp vanilla extract and finally 50g plain flour. Divide the mixture among the darioles or basins.

step 4
You can now either put the mixture in the fridge, or freezer until you're ready to bake them. Can be cooked straight from frozen for 16 mins, or bake now for 10-12 mins until the tops are firm to the touch but the middles still feel squidgy.

step 5
Carefully run a knife around the edge of each pudding, then turn out onto serving plates and serve with single cream.

            step 1
Mix the coffee granules with 2 tbsp boiling water in a large jug and stir to combine. Add the coffee liqueur and 75ml cold water. Pour into a shallow dish and set aside.

step 2
Make the cream layer by beating the mascarpone, condensed milk and vanilla extract with an electric whisk until thick and smooth.

step 3
Break the sponge fingers into two or three pieces and soak in the coffee mixture for a few secs. Put a few bits of the sponge in the bottom of two wine or sundae glasses and top with the cream. Sift over the cocoa and chill for at least 1 hr before serving.
