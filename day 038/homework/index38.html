          Short for Hypertext Markup Language, HTML is the technology that
          creates a structure to display websites on web browsers like Firefox
          or Chrome. It contains text, images, and hypertext. It allows for
          navigation from page to page while providing a user-friendly platform
          for formatting documents.

        <h2>what is front-end ?</h2>
        <p>
          Front-end development is the process of creating the visual and
          interactive aspects of a website or application. Its everything users
          see and engage with in their web browser, often referred to as the
          "client-side" of web development. Front-end developers ensure that
          websites are visually appealing, user-friendly, and functional across
          all devices and browsers.

      <h2>HTMl</h2>
      <p>
        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
        documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
        content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
        technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
        languages such as JavaScript, a programming language. Web browsers
        receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and
        render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the
        structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
        its appearance.
      </p>
      <h3>History of html</h3>
      <p>
        In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and
        prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share
        documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
        hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser
        and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data
        systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for
        funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his
        personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in
        which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4] The
        first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML
        Tags",[5] first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late
        1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively
        simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly
        influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language
        (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements
        still exist in HTML 4.[8]

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
        specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a
        markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
        MathML or XHTML).[2] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide
        Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[3] CSS is designed to enable the
        separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and
        fonts.[4] This separation can improve content accessibility, since the
        content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide
        more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
        characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
        specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces
        complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css
        file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that
        share the file and its formatting.
      </p>
      <h3>history of CSS</h3>
      <p>
        CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie on 10 October 1994.[24] At the
        time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.[25] Several other
        style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time,
        and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web
        Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)[26] being
        released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was influential;
        he became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.[27]
        Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of
        Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was
        developed to provide style sheets for the web.[28] One requirement for a
        web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different
        sources on the web. Therefore, existing style sheet languages like DSSSL
        and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document's
        style be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading"
        styles.[28]

      <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core
        technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use
        JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.[10] Web browsers
        have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These
        engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The
        most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js. JavaScript
        is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to
        the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based
        object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
        supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
        It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text,
        dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document
        Object Model (DOM).
      </p>
      <h3>history of JAVASCRIPT</h3>
      <p>
        Creation at Netscape The first popular web browser with a graphical user
        interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical
        people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the early
        World Wide Web.[12] The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the
        Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape
        Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.[13] During these
        formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the
        capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the
        browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene to
        remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a
        programming language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve
        this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java language,
        while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.[6] The goal
        was a "language for the masses",[14] "to help nonprogrammers create
        dynamic, interactive Web sites".[15] Netscape management soon decided
        that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax
        similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting
        languages.[5][6] Although the new language and its interpreter
        implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a
        Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for
        the official release in December.[6][1][16][17]
